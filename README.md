# Tools & Technologies
Power BI – Data visualization & dashboard creation

SQL – Data extraction and transformation

Excel (.xlsx) – Dataset source file

Power Query Editor – Data cleaning and preprocessing

# Getting Started
# 1. Data Analysis using SQL

All SQL queries used for cleaning and analyzing the pizza sales data are included in the file:
 pizza_sales_analysis.sql

The queries perform operations like:

Calculating total revenue and orders

Finding top-selling pizzas

Determining daily and monthly sales trends

Identifying category and size-wise distribution

# 2. Creating Dashboards using Power BI

The Power BI report file pizza_sales_report.pbix contains all the dashboards built using the SQL data.

Dashboards include:

Total Revenue Overview

Daily and Monthly Trends

Top 5 Pizzas by Revenue

Sales by Category & Size

KPI Cards (Total Sales, Orders, Quantity)

The Pizza Sales Dashboard visually represents the key sales metrics and performance indicators of a pizza business. It provides an intuitive, data-driven view of how products and time factors influence revenue.

Key Components:

KPI Section:
Displays Total Revenue, Total Orders, Average Order Value, and Total Pizzas Sold.

Sales by Category Chart:
Compares performance of Classic, Supreme, Veggie, and Chicken pizzas.

Top 5 Best-Selling Pizzas:
Highlights the pizzas generating the highest revenue and order count.

Sales by Size Chart:
Visualizes which pizza sizes (S, M, L, XL) contribute most to total sales.

Revenue by Date Line Chart:
Shows daily or monthly revenue trends over time.

Hourly & Weekly Heat Map:
Identifies the most active order times and days of the week.

The dashboard is interactive, allowing users to drill down into details, compare time periods, and uncover trends that affect performance.

# Insights Gained

The Large size pizzas contributed to the majority of total revenue.

Classic and Supreme categories were the top-performing categories.

Sales peaked during weekends and evenings, showing customer purchase patterns.

The top 5 pizzas generated more than 50% of total sales.

# Conclusion

This project helped in understanding how real-world sales data can be transformed into business insights using data analytics tools.
By using Power BI and SQL together, I was able to visualize data trends, understand sales behavior, and improve decision-making strategies.

The Pizza Sales Dashboard can be a great resource for restaurant managers and analysts to monitor business performance and optimize their operations.
